# Time-series-calibration

This project is part of my second year training at ENSAE ParisTech (Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique). We are interested in modelizing and predicting the number of Paris Aeroport's international passengers from January 1994 to January 2018 based on monthly datas (see https://insee.fr/fr/statistiques/serie/010001981). 

In this repo you'll find :
